#

Write a function named countOnes that returns the number of ones in the binary representation of its argument. For example, countOnes(9) returns 2 because the binary representation of 9 is 1001.

Some other examples:

countOnes(5) returns 2 because binary 101 equals 5

countOnes(15) returns 4 because binary 1111 equals 15.

You may assume that the argument is greater than 0.

The function prototype is

`int countOnes(int n)`;

Hint use modulo and integer arithmetic to count the number of ones.
