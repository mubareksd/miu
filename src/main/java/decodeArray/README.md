An integer number can be encoded as an array as follows. Each digit n of the number is represented by n  zeros followed by a 1. So the digit 5 is represented by 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1. The encodings of each digit of a  number are combined to form the encoding of the number. So the number 1234 is encoded as the array {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}. The first 0, 1 is contributed by the digit 1, the next 0, 0, 1 is contributed by the digit 2, and so on. 
There is one other encoding rule: if the number is negative, the first element of the encoded array must be 1,  so -201 is encoded as {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}. Note that the 0 digit is represented by no zeros, i.e. there are  two consecutive ones! 
Write a method named decodeArray that takes an encoded array and decodes it to return the number. 
You may assume that the input array is a legal encoded array, i.e., that -1 will only appear as the first 
element, all elements are either 0, 1 or -1 and that the last element is 1. 

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function prototype is 
int decodeArray(int[ ] a) 
If you are programming in C or C++, the function prototype is 
int decodeArray(int a[ ], int len); 
Examples 
a  is then function  returns  reason 
{1} 0 because the digit 0 is represented by no zeros followed by a one. 
{0, 1} 1 because the digit 1 is represented by one zero followed by a one. 
{-1, 0, 1} -1 because the encoding of a negative number begins with a -1 followed by the encoding of the  absolute  value of the number. 
{0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1} 100001 because the encoding of the first 1 is 0, 1, the encoding of each of the 
four 0s is just a 1 and the encoding of the last 1 is 0, 1. 
{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1} 999 because each 9 digit is encoded as 
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.
