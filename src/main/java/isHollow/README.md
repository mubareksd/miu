#

An array is said to be hollow if it contains 3 or more zeros in the middle that are preceded and followed by the same number of non-zero elements. Furthermore, all the zeroes in the array must be in the middle of the array. Write a function named isHollow that accepts an integer array and returns 1 if it is a hollow array, otherwise it returns 0.

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is

`int isHollow(int[ ] a)`

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is

`int isHollow(int a[ ], int len)` where len is the number of elements in the array

Examples:

| if the input array is        | is hollow? | reason                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {1,2,0,0,0,3,4}              | yes        | 2 non-zeros precede and follow 3 zeros in the middle                                                                              |
| {1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,18} | yes        | 4 non-zeros precede and follow the 5 zeros in the middle                                                                          |
| {1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4}           | no         | There are only 2 zeroes in the middle; at least 3 are required                                                                    |
| {1,2,0,0,0,3,4,5}            | no         | The number of preceding non-zeros(2) is not equal to the number of following non-zeros(3)                                         |
| {3,8,3,0,0,0,3,3}            | no         | The number of preceding non-zeros(3) is not equal to the number of following non-zeros(2)                                         |
| {1,2,0,0,0,3,4,0}            | no         | Not all zeros are in the middle                                                                                                   |
| {0,1,2,0,0,0,3,4}            | no         | Not all zeros are in the middle                                                                                                   |
| {0,0,0}                      | yes        | The number of preceding non-zeros is 0 which equals the number of following non-zeros. And there are three zeros "in the middle". |

Hint: Write three loops. The first counts the number of preceding non-zeros. The second counts the number of zeros in the middle. The third counts the number of following non-zeros. Then analyze the results.
