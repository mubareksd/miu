Write a function named nextPerfectSquare that returns the first perfect square that is greater than its integer argument. A **perfect Square** is an integer that is equal to some integer squared. For example 16 is a perfect square because 6 = 4 _ 4. However 15 is not a perfect square because there is no integer n such that 15 = n _ n.

The signature of the function is
`int isPerfectSquare(int n)`

Examples

| n   | next perfect square |
| --- | ------------------- |
| 6   | 9                   |
| 36  | 49                  |
| 0   | 1                   |
| -5  | 0                   |
