#

Define an array to be a 121 array if all elements are either 1 or 2 and the array begins with one or more 1s followed by a one or more 2s and then ends with the same number of 1s that it begins with. Write a method named is121Array that returns 1 if its array argument is a 121 array, otherwise, it returns 0.

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is

`int is121Array(int[ ] a)`

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is

`int is121Array(int a[ ], int len)` where len is the number of elements in the array a.

Examples

| a is                                 | then function returns | reason                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {1, 2, 1}                            | 1                     | because the same number of 1s are at the beginning and end of the array and there is at least one 2 in between them. |
| {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}                | 1                     | because the same number of 1s are at the beginning and end of the array and there is at least one 2 in between them. |
| {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1}             | 0                     | Because the number of 1s at the end does not equal the number of 1s at the beginning.                                |
| {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}             | 0                     | Because the number of 1s at the end does not equal the number of 1s at the beginning.                                |
| {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3}       | 0                     | Because the array contains a number other than 1 and 2.                                                              |
| {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}                   | 0                     | Because the array does not contain any 2s                                                                            |
| {2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1} | 0                     | Because the first element of the array is not a 1.                                                                   |
| {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}    | 0                     | Because the last element of the array is not a 1.                                                                    |
| {2, 2, 2}                            | 0                     | Because there are no 1s in the array.                                                                                |

Hint: Walk through your solution with all the above test cases!
