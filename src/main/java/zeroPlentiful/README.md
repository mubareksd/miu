# QUESTION 13

An array is zero-plentiful if it contains at least one 0 and every sequence of 0s is of length at least 4.

Write a method named isZeroPlentiful which returns the number of zero sequences if its array argument is zero-plentiful, otherwise it returns 0.

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is

`int isZeroPlentiful(int[ ] a)`

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is

`int isZeroPlentiful(int a[ ], int len)` where len is the number of elements in the array a.

Examples

| a is                                                | then function returns | reason                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}                                     | 1                     | 1 because there is one sequence of 0s and its length >= 4.           |
| {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, -18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12}       | 1                     | 2 because there are two sequences of 0s and both have lengths >= 4.  |
| {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} | 1                     | 3 because three are three sequences of zeros and all have length >=4 |
| {1, 2, 3, 4}                                        | 0                     | 0 because there must be at least one 0.                              |
| {1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0}                         | 1                     | 1 because there is a sequence of zeros whose length is less < 4.     |
| {0}                                                 | 0                     | 0 because there is a sequence of zeroes whose length is < 4.         |
| {}                                                  | 0                     | because there must be at least one 0.                                |
