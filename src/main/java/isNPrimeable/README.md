Define an array to be n-primeable if for a given n, all elements of the array when incremented by n are prime. Recall that a prime number is a number that has no factors except 1 and itself. Write a method named isNPrimeable that has an array parameter and an integer parameter that defines n; the method returns 1 if its array parameter is n-primeable; otherwise it returns 0.

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is

`int isNPrimeable(int[ ] a, int n)`

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is

`int isNPrimeable(int a[ ], int len, int n)` where len is the number of elements in the array a.

Examples

| If a is               | and n is | then function returns | reason                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {5, 15, 27}           | 2        | 1                     | 5+2=7 is prime, and 15+2=17 is prime, and 27+2=29 is prime                                                |
| {5, 15, 27}           | 3        | 0                     | 5+3=8 is not prime                                                                                        |
| {5, 15, 26}           | 2        | 0                     | 26+2=28 is not prime                                                                                      |
| {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} | 4        | 1                     | 1+4=5 is prime. This obviously holds for all elements in the array                                        |
| {}                    | 2        | 1                     | Since there are no elements in the array, there cannot exist one that is non-prime when 2 is added to it. |
