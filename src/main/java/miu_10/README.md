. Define the n-based integer rounding of an integer k to be the nearest multiple of n to k. If two multiples  of n are equidistant use the greater one. For example
 the 4-based rounding of 5 is 4 because 5 is closer to 4 than it is to 8, 
 the 5-based rounding of 5 is 5 because 5 is closer to 5 that it is to 10,
 the 4-based rounding of 6 is 8 because 6 is equidistant from 4 and 8, so the greater one is used,  
the 13-based rounding of 9 is 13, because 9 is closer to 13 than it is to 0, 

Write a function named doIntegerBasedRounding that takes an integer array and rounds all its positive 
elements using n-based integer rounding.  
A negative element of the array is not modified and if n <=0, no elements of the array are modified.  Finally you may assume that the array has at least two elements. 
Hint: In integer arithmetic, (6/4) * 4 = 4 

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is 
void doIntegerBasedRounding(int[ ] a, int n) where n is used to do the rounding 

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is 
void doIntegerBasedRounding(int a[ ], int n, int len) where n is used to do the rounding and len is the 
number of elements in the array a. 
Examples 
if a is  	and n is	then a becomes   	reason 

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	2	{2, 2, 4, 4, 6} 
	because the 2-based rounding of 1 is 2, the 2-based 
 
rounding of 2 is 2, the 2-based rounding of 3 is 4, the
2-based rounding of 4 is 4, and the 2-based rounding  of 5 is 6. 

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	3	{0, 3, 3, 3, 6} 
	because the 3-based rounding of 1 is 0, the 3-based 
roundings of 2, 3, 4 are all 3, and the 3-based rounding of 5 is 6. 

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	-3	{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	because the array is not changed if n <= 0.
{-1, -2, -3, -4, -5}	3	{-1, -2, -3, -4, -5}	because negative numbers are not rounded 

{-18, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	4	{-18, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4}	because -18 is negative and hence is not modified, the 
4-based rounding of 1 is 0, and the 4-based roundings 
of 2, 3, 4, 5 are all 4. 
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	5	{0, 0, 5, 5, 5} 
	
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	100	{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
