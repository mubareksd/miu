Define a cluster in an integer array to be a maximum sequence of elements that are all the
same value. For example, in the array {3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4} there are 5 clusters, {3, 3, 3},
{4, 4}, {3}, {2, 2, 2, 2} and {4}. A cluster-compression of an array replaces each cluster with
the number that is repeated in the cluster. So, the cluster compression of the previous array
would be {3, 4, 3, 2, 4}. The first cluster {3, 3, 3} is replaced by a single 3, and so on.
Write a function named clusterCompression with the following signature
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is
int[ ] clusterCompression(int[ ] a)
If you are programming in C++ or C, the function signature is
int *clusterCompression(int a[ ], int len) where len is the length of the array.
The function returns the cluster compression of the array a. The length of the returned array must
be equal to the number of clusters in the original array! This means that someplace in your
answer you must dynamically allocate the returned array.
In Java or C# you can use
int[ ] result = new int[numClusters];
In C or C++ you can use
int *result = (int *)calloc(numClusters, sizeof(int));
Examples
a is then function returns
{0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0} {0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0}
{18} {18}
{} {}
{-5, -5, -5, -5, -5} {-5}
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1} {1, 2, 1}
{8, 8, 6, 6, -2, -2, -2} {8, 6, -2}
