. Define an m-n sequenced array to be an array that contains one or more occurrences of all the integers  between m and n inclusive. Furthermore, the array must be in ascending order and contain only those  integers. For example, {2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5} is a 2-5 sequenced array. The array {2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5} is not a 2-5  sequenced array because it is missing a 4. The array {0, 2, 2, 3, 3} is not a 2-3 sequenced array because the  0 is out of range. And {1,1, 3, 2, 2, 4} is not a 1-4 sequenced array because it is not in ascending order. 
Write a method named isSequencedArray that returns 1 if its argument is a m-n sequenced array, 
otherwise it returns 0. 
If you are writing in Java or C# the function signature is 
int isSequencedArray(int[ ] a, int m, int n) 
If you are writing in C or C++ the function signature is 
int isSequencedArray(int a[ ], int len, int m, int n) where len is the number of elements in the array a. 
You may assume that m<=n 
Examples
if a is and m is and n is	return reason
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }  1   5	 1  because the array contains all the numbers between 1 and  5 inclusive in ascending order  and no other numbers. 

{1, 3, 4, 2, 5}   1     5	0 because the array is not in ascending order.
{-5, -5, -4, -4, -4, -3, -3, -2, -2, -2} -5 -2
	1  because the array contains all the numbers                                                                              between -5 and -2 inclusive in ascending order                                                                             and no other numbers. Note that duplicates are  allowed. 

{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 1 5	 0 because 0 is not in between 1 and 5 inclusive 

{1, 2, 3, 4} 1 5	0    because there is no 5
{1, 2, 5} 1 5	0 because there is no 3 or 4
{5, 4, 3, 2, 1} 1 5                                                   	0 because the array does not start with a 1.                                                                                 Furthermore, it is not in ascending order.
