. An array is called systematically increasing if it consists of increasing sequences of the numbers from 1 
to n.  The first six (there are over 65,000 of them) systematically increasing arrays are: 
{1} 
{1, 1, 2} 
{1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3} 
{1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4} 
{1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
{1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} 
Write a function named isSystematicallyIncreasing which returns 1 if its array argument is systematically 
increasing. Otherwise it returns 0. 
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is 
int isSystematicallyIncreasing(int[ ] a) 
If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is 
int isSystematicallyIncreasing(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array a. 
Examples 
a is then function  returns reason 
{1} 1 because 1 is a sequence from 1 to 1 and is the only sequence. 
{1, 2, 1, 2, 3} 0 because it is missing the sequence from 1 to 1. 
{1, 1, 3} 0 because {1, 3} is not a sequence from 1 to n for any n. 
{1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2} 0 because it contains more than one sequence from 1 to 2. 
{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1} 0 because it is "backwards", i.e., the sequences from 1 to n are not ordered by increasing value of n 
{1, 1, 2, 3} 0 because the sequence {1, 2} is missing (it should precede {1, 2, 3})
